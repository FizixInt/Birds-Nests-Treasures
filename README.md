Bird's Nests & Treasures [BNT] is a random treasure mod for Minecraft 1.14.4, 1.15.2 and 1.16.1 inspired by [CleverPanda's Birds Nest Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/birds-nests). 

BNT adds a number of collectable treasures to the world that can be found while exploring. 

* Bird's Nests
* Bandit's Treasure Pouches
* Sunken Bottles

Each treasure type has it's own possible loot, the possible contents follows what you may expect to find in that type of treasure and is influenced by biome and other conditions.

#### Nests


Birds Nests typically appear from harvesting trees. Nests typically contain small items that have been foraged by birds in the surrounding biome.



#### Bandit Treasure Pouches
Bandit's Treasure Pouches are sacks typically carried by bandits that have been dropped or discarded.  You can find them when harvesting grass and hidden within sand and snow. They contain the items bandits may use or find in their day to day lives.

#### Sunken Bottles
Exploring around beaches, corals, or digging up sans in the ocean may reveal sunken bottles. One illager's rubbish, may be another illager's treasure.

#### Ancient Treasure
Digging in remote places such as deserts, ice caps and tundras may reveal ancient, valuable treasures.

## Configuration
BNT comes with a configuration file where you can:

* Enable or Disable each treasure type. Disabling a treasure type will prevent it from spawning in the world.

* Set whether treasures can be stacked _unstackable by default_

* Set whether nests can be dropped when leaves decay

* Set the rarity of each treasure type.

---

#### Rarity Settings
BNT treasures have a standard rarity for each treasure type. The chance of finding a treasure can increase or decrease under certain conditions.

You can configure the rarity under all 3. 

* Standard/Normal: This is the default rarity

* Lower: Modified rarity for lower rate conditions

* Higher: Modified rarity for higher rate conditions


Rarity followers a 1 in _x_ chance format. Therefore, if the rarity is set to "50", then this will give a 1 in 50 chance of finding a treasure
